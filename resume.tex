\section{Education}

\subsection{Portland State University --- BCS}
Bachelor of Computer Science --- completed May 2021 --- Magna cum laude

\section{Experience}

\subsection{Self Employed $\;\vert\;2014-2017\;\vert\;$ Math and Science Tutor}
Operated a small personal business where I mostly tutored calculus to
engineering students.

\subsection{Portland State University $\;\vert\;2019-2021\;\vert\;$ Technical Course Support Specialist}
Karla Fant teaches a majority of the lower division compute science courses (CS162, CS163, CS202) at PSU\\
Supported her courses by:

\begin{itemize}
\item Facilitate homework recitation and labs
\item Proctor programming proficiency demos and written exams
\item Create course materials
\item Grading and administrative tasks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Portland State University $\;\vert\;2019-2020\;\vert\;$ Undergraduate Research Mentorship Program}
Received a 4 term academic stipend to pursue independent research. My research project worked with recipe data
to create ingredient networks. These networks were analyzed as communities using modularity algorithms and then
the communities were used to create original recipes based on certain constraints. Project involved meeting with
my adviser weekly and giving write-ups or presentation to the program manager.

\subsection{Capstone Project Team Lead $\;\vert\;2021\;\vert\;$}
Was selected by university staff to be a team lead position for the capstone graduation requirement. Our
capstone project was to develop university level codelab exercises to teach concepts about cloud security
and incident management through topics like IAM policies and iterative log querying.
