\section{Personal Interests and Projects}

\subsection{Undergraduate Research Mentorship Program: Culinary Computation}

\subsection{Monte Carlo Simulation of Set\tiny\mdseries\textregistered}
I am interested in the probabilities of this game.\\
Motivations and an analysis I did can be found here:

\subsection{Linear Algebra}
I am co-developed an open source linear algebra library with the help
of Waylon Cude when I was in an advanced linear algebra course at PSU.
The library was to demonstrate my familiarity with sparse matrix operations and algorithms.
As a final project for the class I reimplemented an iterative solver known as GMRES.\\
Here is a link to the project: \href{https://www.gitlab.com/AustenN/matrixlab}{matrixlab}
